# WakeUp-rebuilt
Turn on the screen when you receive a new notification

Reconstructed and updated application to the most recent dependencies as the original project was abandoned

Original Project:
https://github.com/tommasoberlose/wake-up

This app lets you awaken the screen upon arrival of a new notification, you can choose which application will awaken the screen, the length and time you want to wait before the screen wakes up

You can decide whether to act even when you have the phone in silent mode or when you have it in your pocket.

Works with all applications

Useful if you do not have the notification led

You do not need to install any other app, it does not require any third-party lookscreen to work
